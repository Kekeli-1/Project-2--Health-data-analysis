# Project-2--Health-data-analysis
Exploratory data analysis on health factors related to diabetes 
This project explores health related  behavioral and demographic factors  and their relationship
with diabetes, BMI, and general wellbeing using a real-world health survey dataset.

## DATASET
The dataset was obtained from a health survey and loaded into Dbeaver for analysis. This project explores a U.S 
healthcare dataset using SQL in Dbeaver.
It includes features such as 
-Diabetes_binary
- `BMI`
- `Education`
- `GenHealth`
- `Fruits`, `Vegetables`
- `PhysicalActivity`
- `HighBP`,`HighChol
- `Smoker`,`Stroke`, and more
- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical data, some of which are encoded using binary values
-In features like Diabetes_binary,HighBP,HighChol,Cholcheck,Smoker,Stroke,Heart_disease_or_attack,
-PhysicalActivity,Fruits,Vegetables where there are only ones and zeros means (`1` = YES, `0`= NO)
-GenHealth(`1`= Execellent, `2`= VeryGood,`3`= Good,`4`= Fair,`5`= Poor)
-BMI(High-BMI(>=25) indicate overweight or obesity)
-Age(`1`= 18-24, `2`= 25-29, `3`=30-34, `4`=35-39, `5`=40-44, `6`=45-49, `7`=50-54, `8`=55-59, `9`=60-69, `10`=65-69, `11`=70-74, `12`=75-79,`13`=80-84)
-Income(low-income earners=(1,2,3,4), Middle_class earners(5,6,7), High-income earners(8))
-Education(`1`=Never attended school, `2`=Elementary, `3`=Some high school, `4`=High school graduate, `5`=Some college, `6`=College Graduate)

 ## Key INSIGHTS
 - 15.83% of the population has diabetes
 - Middle-class earners have the highest average BMI(28.78)
 - College Graduates have the highest average diabetic rate of 0.1241
 - Only 44.83% of diabetic patients consume fruits and vegetables regulary.
 - Physically active individuals tend to have a lower BMI, though they just form 20.57% of the dataset.
 - Low income earners are more likely to report poor general health (3.29%)
 - Physically inactive patients have an average mental health of 4.86 making 27.57%.
 - High income earners have the most number of diabetic patients(6,994).
